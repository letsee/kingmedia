## Quick Start
#### 1. Setup JSON configuration file:

*letsee-marker.json:*
```json
{
	"uri":"letsee-marker.json",
	"name":"Letsee WebAR SDK",
	"size":{
		"width": 200,
		"height": 140
	},
	"scale": 1,
	"image": "/path/to/image.jpg"
}
```

**Please check this carefully before you go more further in your steps:**

|Properties|Required|Explanation|
|:---|:---|:---|
|`uri`|Required|A unique value that specifies the object. This `uri` is the same name as the file name.<br/>Here we name as `letsee-marker.json`.|
|`name`|Optional|Name for the object.<br/>You can declare with any name you prefer. For demo purpose, we use our marker and name as `Letsee WebAR SDK`.|
|`size`|Required|Enter the actual size of the object. The unit is `mm`. <br/><ul><li>planner tracker : Actual size of the image target.</li><li>marker tracker: Actual size of the marker you wish to use.</li></ul>|
|`scale`|Optional|The scale of the content being augmented. Default is `1`. If the `"scale": 1` means the augmented content matches 1:1 with the size enter above.|
|`image`|Required|For `IMAGE` Tracking.<br/><br/>Reference image to use for planar tracker. You can enter a URL or a relative path that begins with `https`.<br/>However, if you enter a relative path, be careful with the path of the web page where the AR app is running.</br><ul><li>Extension: Must be in **.jpg** or **.png** formats.</li><li>Capacity: Up to 2MB in size.</li><li>Pixel size: Up to 640,000 horizontal and vertical pixels.</li></ul> |
|`letseeMarkerId`|Required|For `MARKER` Tracking.<br/><br/>The marker ID to be used for tracking.<br/>A total of 250 markers are available, from 0 to 249 can be used. Input is `"marker_” + numeric`.|

For `IMAGE` tracking, you can use any planar image such as movie posters or product packaging, then put them into your project directory to start
tracking and building your application.

#### 2. Setup CSS `media="place"`:

```html
<head>
...
    <style media="place" type="text/css">
        #container {
            -letsee-target: uri('letsee-marker.json');
        }
    </style>
...
</head>
```

Please put this CSS `media="place"` in your `<head>` tag, and `media="media"` MUST BE included for rendering AR content.

**By adding a media query `media="place"`, you are gonna to tell the browser this page is available or ready for AR-enabled.**

|Attributes|Description|
|:---|:---|
|`#container`|CSS selector: Same as the element selector used in normal CSS.|
|`-letsee-target`|The path of the `.json` file containing the entity configuration.|
|`-letsee-transform`|Any position with respect to the center point of the recognized object on the screen.|

#### 3. App setting:
This will show how to setup and create an app using the Letsee WebAR SDK.
This script loads the SDK according to the configuration file (`.json`) and `YOUR_APP_KEY`.

```html
<body>

	<div id="container">
		<h1>Hello, world!</h1>
	</div>
	
	<!-- Loading the Letsee WebAR Engine -->
	<script>
		const config = {
			"appKey": "YOUR_APP_KEY", 
	        "trackerType": "IMAGE",
		};
		const app = new Letsee(config);
	</script>
	
</body>
```

|Attributes|Required|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|`appKey`|Required|AppKey for license authorization.<|
|`trackerType`|Required|Target recognition mode.<br/>You can set `IMAGE` or `MARKER` depends on what you want to track.<br/><br/>The `IMAGE` tracker recognizes and tracks one entity of the first declared `-letsee-target`. The `MARKER` tracker can track five markers simultaneously.|

You first need to replace `YOUR_APP_KEY` with your own app key. In case of planar image tracking, the `trackerType` should be defined as `IMAGE`.
Then, the `<div>` tag has an `id` which MUST BE the same as the CSS selector defined in `media="media"` `<style>` tag. Here is `#container`.<br/>
Inside this `<div>`, you can create any content as much as you like to augment it and see the magic happens.

#### 4. Serve Application
##### Deploy to A Web Server
If you have a development web server, upload the sample project and connect from a mobile device.
You'll need to **connect via HTTPS** as browsers require `HTTPS` certificates to access the camera on your phone through a browser.

##### Deploy to A Local Server
Developers are encouraged to build local web servers because in most cases they are developed on personal computers and verified on
mobile devices.

Setting up a local web server can usually be done in several way. This article describes two different methods using
Python (SimpleHTTPServer) or [Node.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) as an easy way to set up an HTTPS
connection to an installed local web server.

###### Using Node.js
1. Install Node.js and npm:<br>
If you don't already have Node.js and npm installed, please get it here [https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
and for installation instruction, check it [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

2. Open Terminal and type following commands:
```bash
$ npm install http-server -g
$ cd <your_project_directory>
$ http-server
```

By default, this package sets the root of the `./public` folder (or the `./` folder) which is the point of execution and
binds it to port `8080`. For more options, please refer to [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server).

###### Using Python
Open Terminal and type following commands:

```bash
// Checking python version
$ python -v

$ cd <your_project_directory>

// Python 2.x
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer

// Python 3.x
$ python -m http.server
```

This module defaults to the root of the command execution and binds to port 8000. See the following links for more options:
([SimpleHTTPServer-Python 2.x](https://docs.python.org/2/library/simplehttpserver.html), [http.server-Python 3](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html))

###### Using ngrok
Alternatively, you can use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) to server application locally.
The following command executes the tunneling function of `ngrok`, which can access the local web server on port `8000` from the outside.

For detailed `ngrok` configuration, please check it [here]((https://ngrok.com/docs)).

```bash
$ ngrok http 8000
```
